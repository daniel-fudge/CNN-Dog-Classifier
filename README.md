# CNN-Dog-Classifier
This repo trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the breed of dog from images.  The motivation
for this program was the 2nd project in the Udacity Deep Learning 
[Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). 

## How to run
This project can be executed directly from within the [dog_app.ipynb](dog_app.ipynb) Jupyter notebook.  Due to the time 
required to train the CNN, it is recommended that a GPU is used.  The output shown in the report and notebook were 
generated on AWS' Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu 18.04) Version 26.0 with a p2.xlarge instance.


## Report
A [report](report.pdf) was generated from the [Jupyter Notebook](dog_app.ipynb) for those who prefer pdf files.
